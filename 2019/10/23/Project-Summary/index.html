        <p>My project is Internet economic analysis of online shopping based on data mining. Internet economics is a subject does research on economics of network service Market. Internet economics mainly studies the allocation of limited resources, the profit of Internet investment and appropriate government policies from the perspective of Internet service price and competition of service providers. While researching this project, the main aim is to achieve the economic interpretation of the “Cloud” part of the Internet. This is a project which explores about the shopping economics, such as how sellers attract consumers to buy more products, how they make a sales plan, and so on. There are many factors which will influence the sales. In this project, my aim is to figure out the online shopping trading strategy, do microeconomic analysis of E-Commerce market and predict the strategic prospect of E-Commerce development by using python 3 to help me arrange and analyze the data. While working out the project, I learned how to write python 3 code and the research methods and the theoretical framework of the Internet shopping economics.</p>
<p>There are many laws, effects and models of Internet economics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metcalfe’s Law<br>It’s one of the three main laws of the Internet. The value of an Internet is equal to the square of the number of nodes in the Internet, and the value of the network is proportional to the square of the number of users on the Internet.<br>This law can be illustrated directly by Network Externality.<br>Network Externality:</li>
</ul>
<p>Network Externality is one of the forms of market failure. When private cost is unequal to social cost, Network Externality exists.</p>
<p>private cost &gt; social cost, there is Negative Externality<br>private cost &lt; social cost, there is Positive Externality<br>The Existence of Externality distorts the whole economic efficiency by making private decisions based on the principle that marginal revenue equals marginal cost.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matthew Effect<br>The strong will always be strong, the weak will always be weak as well. So do the rich and the poor. Matthew Effect can be described by positive feedback. The existence of Matthew Effect enables manufacturers to expand the scale of their product network through expected management.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Path-Dependence<br>Any ephemeral advantage, unimportant advantage, or a seemingly unrelated event may all probably have an important and irreversible impact on the final allocation of market resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moore’s Law<br>Moore’s Law reflects the speed of technological updating and upgrading in the field of network information, communication, the crisis and motivation faced by enterprise developments. Under the action of Moore’s law, if enterprises want to develop well, they have to learn ceaselessly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gilder’s Law<br>The most successful business model is that the lowest-priced resources will be consumed as much as possible to conserve the most expensive resources. With the rapid development of communication capability, the transmission price per bit will approach the free direction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Porter’s Five Forces Analysis Model<br>Porter’s Five Forces Analysis Model has a global impact on enterprise strategy formulation. It can be used in competitive strategy analysis, and can also analyze the competitive environment of the consumers efficiently.<br>The five forces are the competitiveness of existing competitors in the same industry, the entry ability of potential competitors, the substitution ability of substitutes, the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of buyers. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The bargaining power of buyers:<br>The new entrants will bring new production capacity and new resources to the industry. Meanwhile, they will hope to win a place in the market that has been carved up by the existing enterprises, which may compete with the existing enterprises in raw material and market share, and eventually lead to the lower profit level of the existing enterprises in the industry. The severity of competitive entry threats depends on two factors: the size of barriers to entry into new areas and the expected response of existing enterprises to entrants.</p>
<p>-The bargaining power of suppliers:<br>Buyers mainly influence the profitability of existing enterprises in the industry through their ability to reduce prices and demand to provide higher quality products or services.</p>
<p>-The entry ability of potential competitors:<br>The new entrants will bring new production capacity and new resources to the industry. Meanwhile, they will hope to win a place in the market that has been carved up by the existing enterprises, which may compete with the existing enterprises in raw material and market share, and eventually lead to the lower profit level of the existing enterprises in the industry. The severity of competitive entry threats depends on two factors: the size of barriers to entry into new areas and the expected response of existing enterprises to entrants.</p>
<p>-The competitiveness of existing competitors in the same industry:<br>Most of the enterprises in the industry are closely related to each other’s interests. As a part of the overall strategy of enterprises, their competitive strategies aim at making their own enterprises gain advantages over their competitors. Therefore, conflicts and confrontations will inevitably occur in the implementation. These conflicts and confrontations constitute the competition among existing enterprises. Competition among existing enterprises is often manifested in price, advertising, product introduction, after sales service and so on, and its competitive intensity is related to many factors.</p>
<p>-The substitution ability of substitutes:<br>Two enterprises in different industries may produce competitive behavior between them because the products they produce are substitutes for each other. This competition originating from substitutes will affect the competitive strategy of existing enterprises in the industry in various forms.<br>In additional, I also wrote some codes.</p>

<p>During the process, I also met some challenges. The biggest challenge which I met is the coding part. Due to I hadn’t learn how to write code before working on this project, I knew nothing about writing code. At first, it’s been so difficult that I was puzzled about python. But after learning and practicing, it wasn’t as hard as before. I could write some easy code by myself. When I still had problems on writing code, I would search for these problems on the Internet, or ask a favor from my teacher.</p>
<p>When dealing with the project, the most interesting part is also writing the code. Because of the curiosity about programming, I am very interested in programming. It was total a new thing to me. Therefore, it attracted me a lot. I learned many sentences and grammars about programming. These grammars and sentences attracted me a lot. That’s why writing code was the most interesting part in this project.<br>In this project, I learned many things, like how to program and some economic analyzing methods. These helped me a lot.</p>
